POSITIVE,POSITIVE,"LOVE IT HERE, COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. GREAT DISPATCHER, GREAT MILES, GREAT EQUIPMENT."
NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,"If you work at Crete and you are actually honest then you'll know why the one-star rating. Unless you are among the minority who seem to have everything handed to them and then of course you will disagree with a one-star rating. It is what it is. Same everywhere you go. Unless you're Craig Pinto who commented below. I've been driving for 13 years and I believe a drivers opinion is important when making a decision whether or not to work for a company. I don't feel the need to accuse drivers who make negative comments has being"" whiny"". That's like saying all the drivers who have good comments are"" kiss asses"". It wouldn't be fair would it? Why don't you take your own words to Heart. If you supposedly know that everybody's experience will be different and not every driver would be a good fit for this particular company, then you should also know that there will be good reviews and bad reviews."
NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,Ever since I started working for crete...my wife goes shoppin' everyday..(in my new car)!! It's rediculous!!
NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,"DISCRIMINATION in the Workplace. I was really shocked to hear a family member of mine went to try and apply for Crete Corp. I thought equal opportunity applied to EVERYONE here in the U.S. IT does NOT apply for working ate Crete. Apparently if a person has a bad credit score, Crete finds this to be a ""risk"" and WILL NOT hire you. Which any idiot knows, that people APPLY for jobs when they are out of money or in need of it. To me, this is MAJOR discrimination in the workforce, AND to those that may not have upper class privileges. I hope the DOL shuts down Crete."

POSITIVE,POSITIVE,Sam is amazing. She is a master craftsman and gives an amazing haircut. She listens to what is needed and gave me one of the best haircuts I ever received.

NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,I won't go into detail about how another local salon screwed up my hair- but when I called Vanity at 9am on Saturday to tell them about my situation they...
POSITIVE,POSITIVE,I had a fantastic first time experience at Vanity Salon! Alisha is INCREDIBLE. She spent a lot of time with me going over what color and cut would look best...
POSITIVE,POSITIVE,"Bianca did my color last week; and it was just what I asked for. I was so pleased that I went back today for a Keratin Express. She is personable - and most importantly, she listens. Vanity, great addition to your team. This young lady is excellent!"
POSITIVE,POSITIVE,The first thing you will notice upon walking into this salon is how beautiful it is.The attention to detail given to every inch of the space is indicative of the attention that each client receives from every member of the Vanity team. My hair is healthier and longer than it's ever been and I know it is because of the skill and artistry of Nicole and her staff. I love that they are always learning and studying new techniques to stay ahead of the current styles. Looking for a great salon? One word ... VANITY!
POSITIVE,POSITIVE,"Will never go anywhere else for my hair! Best of the best. I even moved to nyc and still come here for any cut, dye, style, teatment. The staff is so good at what they do. I see Antonia and she nails it every time!"
POSITIVE,POSITIVE,"I've been going to Alyssa at Vanity for years now and she does an amazing job every time. The environment is welcoming, the staff always offers you tea/coffee/water when you sit down. The salon is very clean and I never have a problem making an appointment, however, I do make all my appointments in advance because Alyssa is so popular! Alyssa has done my wedding hair and my sister's hair and the quality of cut, style, color, blow dry is excellent. I definitely recommend Vanity Salon!"

NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,If you want fast and reliable then call Jon!
POSITIVE,POSITIVE,"Polite, friendly, and best in the Industry in Dry Vans and always early for the drops. If you need anything shipped out of the Northeast then I highly recommend this company."
NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,I worked at Roberts Trucking Company full-time (More than a year) Pros The Roberts family are just good people. They treat you right and know everyone by name. Very willing to work with you during family issues or problems. Cons Hired on new upper management and since it has gone downhill some. Partially due to the economy I am sure and partially due to changing things to run like a huge company. Advice to Management Don't forget that people still need to be treated like people and not just employees during all the changes going on. Roberts Trucking Company 2017-02-03 07:50 PST
NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,"Worst repair shop in the Erie Pa area. They are wayyy overpriced and the service is terrible. I was told to ""f off"" by the manager when I called him out on getting over charged for the work they have done on my truck. I WOULD'NT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORST ENEMY!"
